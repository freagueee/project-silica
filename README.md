# project-silica
A script based Minecraft: Bedrock client


# What is this?
Project Silica is made to be a client within a Python script. It is developed for fast updates and people who want a small but useful mod menu.

# Who are you?
I am a C++ developer, and I spend my time making things for the Bedrock edition of Minecraft. This script is not anything special as I don't know much Python and wanted to make something fast. lol
